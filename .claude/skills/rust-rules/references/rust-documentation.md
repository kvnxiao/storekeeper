# Documentation Requirements

## Public API Documentation (Default)

Default public library items to useful documentation that states the purpose and any invariants, failure paths, panics, or side effects the signature cannot express. Examples are appropriate when usage is not apparent from the type and name; redundant `# Arguments` sections and fixed paragraph structures are omitted.

```rust
/// Normalize an account name for storage.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`NameError::Empty`] if `input` contains no visible characters.
pub fn normalize_name(input: &str) -> Result<AccountName, NameError> {
    todo!()
}
```

## Module Documentation (Default)

Default public modules to a concise model and primary entry points. An example is appropriate when it clarifies how the items compose.

```rust
//! Load and validate application configuration.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use my_library::config::Config;
//!
//! let config = Config::from_file("config.toml")?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
```

## Substantial public module guide (Conditional)

When a public module introduces a substantial concept or several related types, document its model, primary entry points, and selection guidance. Use headings that fit the subject; the module does not need a fixed skeleton.

```rust
//! Provide facilities for civil (time-zone-less) datetimes.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! - [`Date`]: a calendar date.
//! - [`Time`]: a wall-clock time.
//!
//! ```
//! use my_crate::civil::date;
//! let d = date(2024, 3, 14);
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # What is "civil" time?
//!
//! Civil time represents local calendar values without a time-zone offset.
//!
//! # When should I use civil time?
//!
//! Use civil time for calendar input before a time zone is known.
```

## Crate Root as Cookbook and Spec (Conditional)

For a published library, the crate root:

- Lists what the crate supports and does not support, with each unsupported feature linked to a tracking issue.
- States the panic policy ("APIs that panic by design are few and clearly documented as such").
- Includes a short cookbook of runnable, task-oriented examples.

## Long-Form Rationale via `include_str!` (Conditional)

When long-form design rationale exists, keep it in top-level Markdown and render it into rustdoc through a hidden documentation module.

```rust
pub mod _documentation {
    #[doc = include_str!("../DESIGN.md")]
    pub mod design {}
    #[doc = include_str!("../PLATFORM.md")]
    pub mod platform {}
}
```

## Own Your `docs.rs` cfg Knob (Conditional)

When a crate uses nightly-only documentation attributes, use a crate-specific cfg name instead of the shared `docsrs` name. Another crate can otherwise enable the shared cfg unexpectedly.

```toml
[package.metadata.docs.rs]
all-features = true
rustdoc-args = ["--cfg", "docsrs_mycrate"]
```

```rust
#![cfg_attr(docsrs_mycrate, feature(doc_cfg))]
```
