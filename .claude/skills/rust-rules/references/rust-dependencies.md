# Dependency Management

## Default to Caret/Semver Ranges (Default)

For both libraries and applications, default dependency declarations to caret or SemVer ranges, which Cargo uses for unprefixed versions. A committed `Cargo.lock` fixes the resolved versions; an exact `Cargo.toml` requirement is not needed for reproducibility.

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "net", "macros"] }
```

Default binaries to a committed `Cargo.lock`. For libraries, commit it when the test or CI environment needs reproducible resolution. Caret bounds let `cargo update` select patch fixes while the lockfile keeps normal builds fixed.

## Preferred Crates (Default)

For projects using this rule pack, default to the preferred crates below when their contracts fit the task. Use an alternative when compatibility, platform support, an existing dependency graph, or a missing capability makes it a better fit.

| Domain | Preferred | Common alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Dates and times | `jiff` | `chrono`, `time` |
| Filesystem IO | `fs-err` | `std::fs` |
| UTF-8 paths | `camino` (`Utf8Path` / `Utf8PathBuf`) | `std::path::Path` / `PathBuf` |

Record lasting dependency policy and approved deviations in project documentation. A transitive dependency on `chrono` or `time` does not require first-party code to adopt it.

## Pin Exact Versions Only When Necessary (Default)

Exact pins (`"=1.2.3"`) restrict Cargo's resolver, prevent normal updates, and can cause version-resolution conflicts in workspaces or downstream consumers. Use them only for a named constraint:

- **Patch-version regression.** A patch release introduced a bug or behavior change that breaks you. Pin to the last good version until upstream fixes it, and link the issue.
- **Behavioral dependency on a specific version.** You rely on a quirk that isn't part of the crate's contract and could shift across patches. Prefer fixing your code over pinning, but pin if the fix is non-trivial.
- **`cargo install` distribution.** Binaries published via `cargo install` ignore `Cargo.lock` by default unless `--locked` is passed; if you can't guarantee `--locked`, pinning is the only way to lock end-user versions.
- **Resolver conflict resolution.** A transitive-version conflict requires a specific version to keep the dep graph valid.
- **Tightly-coupled internal crate pair.** A facade crate that re-exports a private helper relying on the facade's unstable internals (`serde` ↔ `serde_core`, `thiserror` ↔ `thiserror-impl`, `jiff` ↔ `jiff-static`) pins the helper with `=` to the exact same version. They ship in lockstep and call each other's private APIs, so a mismatched pair would break. This is the one place a `=` pin is the norm rather than a smell — you own both crates and bump them together.

```toml
[dependencies]
# Temporary pin: remove after https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/XXXX ships.
serde = "=1.0.195"

thiserror-impl = { version = "=2.0.18", path = "impl" }
```

For a temporary pin, add an adjacent comment with its removal condition and issue link. For a lasting pin such as a coupled internal crate pair, record the policy in project documentation. If no named constraint applies, use a caret range; the lockfile already fixes resolved versions for reproducible builds.

## Enable Only Needed Features (Default)

Default dependency declarations to the features the project uses. Enable a full feature set when the dependency contract requires it or selective features would create an unsupported combination.

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "net", "macros"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

## Review Dependencies Regularly (Default)

Default dependency maintenance to automated update checks, security audits, and unused-dependency detection. Substitute equivalent tools when the project already standardizes on them.

```bash
cargo outdated

cargo audit

cargo machete
```

## Single-Source the MSRV (Default)

Default `rust-version` to one declaration in `[package]` or `[workspace.package]`, and have CI read the MSRV from it. A second version in CI YAML can drift unless external tooling requires and verifies both values.
